Instructions to install kubernetes in Ubuntu 22.04.

Introduction

Kubernetes is an open-source platform for OCI-compliant container workload orchestration. As a container orchestrator, Kubernetes automates the deployment of containers across multiple systems and helps scale and manage containerized applications.

This guide teaches you how to install Kubernetes on Ubuntu 22.04 by following five steps.

Prerequisites

    Two or more servers running Ubuntu 22.04.
    Command-line access.
    Access to a user account with sudo privileges on each system.

On AWS EC2 setup the security group that allows following ports for inbound connections - 
    
    SSH (Port 22)
    All traffic for Kubernetes control plane (Port 6443)
    NodePort Services (30000â€“32767)

Set up Docker

Kubernetes requires a CRI-compliant container engine runtime such as Docker, containerd, or CRI-O. This article shows you how to deploy Kubernetes using Docker.

Install Docker on each server node by executing the steps below:

  1. Update the package list:

    sudo apt update

  2. Install Docker with the following command:

    sudo apt install docker.io -y
  3. Set Docker to launch on boot by entering:

    sudo systemctl enable docker

  4. Verify Docker is running:

    sudo systemctl status docker

  5. If Docker is not running, start it with the following command:

    sudo systemctl start docker

Install Kubernetes

Setting up Kubernetes on an Ubuntu system involves adding the Kubernetes repository to the APT sources list and installing the relevant tools. Follow the steps below to install Kubernetes on all the nodes in your cluster.

  Step 1: Add Kubernetes Signing Key
  Since Kubernetes comes from a non-standard repository, download the signing key to ensure the software is authentic. On each node, use the curl command to download the key and store it in a safe place (default is /etc/apt/keyrings/:

    curl -fsSL https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.30/deb/Release.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg

  Step 2: Add Software Repositories
   Kubernetes is not included in the default Ubuntu repositories. To add the Kubernetes repository to your list, enter this command on each node:

    echo 'deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg] https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.30/deb/ /' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list

  Ensure all packages are up to date:

    sudo apt update

  Step 3: Install Kubernetes Tools

  Each Kubernetes deployment consists of three separate tools:

    Kubeadm. A tool that initializes a Kubernetes cluster by fast-tracking the setup using community-sourced best practices.
    Kubelet. The work package that runs on every node and starts containers. The tool gives you command-line access to clusters.
    Kubectl. The command-line interface for interacting with clusters.
  Execute the following commands on each server node to install the Kubernetes tools:

  1. Run the install command:
  
    sudo apt install kubeadm kubelet kubectl
  
  2. Mark the packages as held back to prevent automatic installation, upgrade, or removal:
  
    sudo apt-mark hold kubeadm kubelet kubectl
  
  3. Verify the installation with:
  
    kubeadm version

Deploy Kubernetes

With the necessary tools installed, proceed to deploy the cluster. Follow the steps below to make the necessary system adjustments, initialize the cluster, and join worker nodes.

  Step 1: Prepare for Kubernetes Deployment
  
  This section shows you how to prepare the servers for a Kubernetes deployment. Execute the steps below on each server node:

  1. Disable all swap spaces with the swapoff command:

    sudo swapoff -a

  Then use the sed command below to make the necessary adjustments to the /etc/fstab file:

    sudo sed -i '/ swap / s/^\(.*\)$/#\1/g' /etc/fstab

  2. Load the required containerd modules. Start by opening the containerd configuration file in a text editor, such as nano:

    sudo nano /etc/modules-load.d/containerd.conf

  3. Add the following two lines to the file:

    overlay
    br_netfilter

  Save the file and exit.

  4. Next, use the modprobe command to add the modules:

    sudo modprobe overlay

    sudo modprobe br_netfilter

  5. Open the kubernetes.conf file to configure Kubernetes networking:

    sudo nano /etc/sysctl.d/kubernetes.conf

  6. Add the following lines to the file:

    net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 1
    net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables = 1
    net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1

  Save the file and exit.

  7. Reload the configuration by typing:

    sudo sysctl --system

  Step 2: Assign Unique Hostname for Each Server Node
  
  1. Decide which server will be the master node. Then, enter the command on that node to name it accordingly:
  
    sudo hostnamectl set-hostname master-node
  
  2. Next, set the hostname on the first worker node by entering the following command:
  
    sudo hostnamectl set-hostname worker01
  
  If you have additional worker nodes, use this process to set a unique hostname on each.
  
  3. Edit the hosts file on each node by adding the IP addresses and hostnames of the servers that will be part of the cluster.

         10.0.17.180 master-node
         10.0.21.231 worker01
         10.128.0.4 worker02

  5. Restart the terminal application to apply the hostname change.
  
Step 3: Initialize Kubernetes on Master Node
  
  Once you finish setting up hostnames on cluster nodes, switch to the master node and follow the steps to initialize Kubernetes on it:
  
  1. Open the kubelet file in a text editor.
  
    sudo nano /etc/default/kubelet
  
  2. Add the following line to the file:
  
    KUBELET_EXTRA_ARGS="--cgroup-driver=cgroupfs"
  
  Save and exit.

  3. Reload the configuration and restart the kubelet:
  
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl restart kubelet
  
  4. Open the Docker daemon configuration file:
  
    sudo nano /etc/docker/daemon.json

  5. Append the following configuration block:
  
          {
            "exec-opts": ["native.cgroupdriver=systemd"],
            "log-driver": "json-file",
            "log-opts": {
            "max-size": "100m"
         },
         "storage-driver": "overlay2"
         }

     Save the file and exit.

  6. Reload the configuration and restart Docker:

    sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl restart docker

  7. Open the kubeadm configuration file:

    sudo nano /usr/lib/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf

  8. Add the following line to the file:

    Environment="KUBELET_EXTRA_ARGS=--fail-swap-on=false"

  Save the file and exit.

  9. Reload the configuration and restart the kubelet:

    sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl restart kubelet

  10. Finally, initialize the cluster by typing:

    sudo kubeadm init --control-plane-endpoint=master-node --upload-certs

  Once the operation finishes, the output displays a kubeadm join command at the bottom. Make a note of this command, as you will use it to join the worker nodes to the cluster.

  11. Create a directory for the Kubernetes cluster:

    mkdir -p $HOME/.kube

  12. Copy the configuration file to the directory:

    sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config

  13. Change the ownership of the directory to the current user and group using the chown command:

    sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

  Step 4: Deploy Pod Network to Cluster

  A pod network is a way to allow communication between different nodes in the cluster. This tutorial uses the Flannel node network manager to create a pod network.

  Apply the Flannel manager to the master node by executing the steps below:

  1. Use kubectl to install Flannel:

    kubectl apply -f https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/releases/latest/download/kube-flannel.yml

  2. Untaint the node:

    kubectl taint nodes --all node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane-

  Step 5: Join Worker Node to Cluster

  Repeat the following steps on each worker node to create a cluster:

  1. Stop and disable AppArmor:

    sudo systemctl stop apparmor && sudo systemctl disable apparmor

  2. Restart containerd:

    sudo systemctl restart containerd.service

  3. Apply the kubeadm join command from Step 3 on worker nodes to connect them to the master node. Prefix the command with sudo:

    sudo kubeadm join [master-node-ip]:6443 --token [token] --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:[hash]

  Replace [master-node-ip], [token], and [hash] with the values from the kubeadm join command output.

  4. After a few minutes, switch to the master server and enter the following command to check the status of the nodes:

    kubectl get nodes

  The system displays the master node and the worker nodes in the cluster.
  
  5. On worker nodes, run the following commands to copy kubelet config files on root home directory under .kube/. This will help to locate kubelets.
      1.     sudo cp /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf /root/.kube/config
      2.     sudo kubectl get nodes
